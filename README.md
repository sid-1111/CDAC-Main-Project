### 🎯 Problem Statement
In the competitive e-commerce landscape, understanding customer behavior, optimizing logistics, and forecasting sales are critical for growth. This project addresses key business challenges faced by the Brazilian e-commerce platform, Olist, by leveraging data science to unlock actionable insights from their historical data, ultimately aiming to enhance customer satisfaction and improve operational efficiency.

### 💡 Solution Overview
This project delivers a multi-faceted analytics solution that provides deep insights into the Olist e-commerce dataset. It combines advanced data analysis, machine learning, and interactive data visualization to create a comprehensive tool for business intelligence. The core of the project involves sentiment analysis of customer feedback, sales and revenue forecasting, customer/seller segmentation, and a root-cause analysis of delivery delays. The final insights are consolidated into a user-friendly Power BI dashboard and a predictive web application.

### ✨ Key Features & Methodologies
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Leverages NLP models (BERT, Hugging Face) to classify thousands of customer reviews, providing a real-time pulse on customer satisfaction and identifying areas for service improvement.
- **Time-Series Forecasting:** Forecasts future sales and order volumes using advanced models like Prophet, ARIMA/SARIMA, and XGBoost, enabling better inventory and resource management.
- **Customer & Product Segmentation:** Applies clustering algorithms to segment customers, sellers, and products based on purchasing behavior and characteristics, uncovering valuable patterns for targeted marketing strategies.
- **Delivery Delay Analysis:** Utilizes Spark SQL for large-scale analysis of logistics data to identify key bottlenecks and predict potential delivery delays, helping to optimize the supply chain.
